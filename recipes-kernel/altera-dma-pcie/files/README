altera_dma -- Linux driver
--------------------------

These files have been adapted to kirkstone yocto build.

It sort of works at the moment.

INSTALL & RUN
-------------

To make and install the driver,
    sudo ./install <device_family>

*device_family - arria10,cyclone10,stratix10

To bring up a simple menu to issue commands to the driver,
    sudo ./run
